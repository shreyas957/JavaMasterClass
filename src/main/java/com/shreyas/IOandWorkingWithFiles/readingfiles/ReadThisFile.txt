If we look at the code of the FileReader class, then we’ll notice that the class contains minimal code for creating a FileReader object and no other methods.
This raises questions like “Who does the heavy lifting behind this class?”
To answer this question, we must understand the concept and hierarchy of the Reader class in Java.
Reader is an abstract base class that makes reading characters possible through one of its concrete implementations.
It defines the following basic operations of reading characters from any medium such as memory or the filesystem:
Read a single character
Read an array of characters
Mark and reset a given position in a stream of characters
Skip position while reading a character stream
Close the input stream
Naturally, all the implementations of Reader class must implement all the abstract methods, namely read() and close().
Moreover, most implementations also override other inherited methods to give additional functionality or better performance.
